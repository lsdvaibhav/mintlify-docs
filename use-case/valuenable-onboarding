## Problem Statement 3: Retention & Renewal Nudges

### Context  
Life insurance policies often lapse or go unrenewed due to lack of customer awareness, poor engagement, or ineffective reminder systems. ValuEnableâ€™s policyholders face similar challenges, where limited personalized nudges result in missed renewals and reduced long-term retention.

### Problem  
- Customers are unaware of upcoming renewals or the impact of lapses.  
- Current reminders are generic (SMS/email), leading to low engagement.  
- Lack of personalized communication based on customer profile, history, and policy type.  
- Customers cannot easily visualize the future value or risks of not renewing.  

### Impact  
- Higher policy lapse rates, directly reducing insurer and platform revenue.  
- Missed opportunities to retain customers through proactive engagement.  
- Reduced trust as customers may feel uninformed about policy benefits.  
- Operational inefficiency due to reactive support interventions post-lapse.  

### Desired Outcome  
- Proactive, personalized communication that improves renewal rates.  
- Multi-channel nudges (SMS, voice, video) delivered at the optimal time.  
- Customers understand the tangible benefits of renewing vs. risks of lapsing.  
- Increased trust and stronger customer relationships, leading to higher retention.  

### Approach  
- **Personalized Content Generation Engine**: Use RAG to fetch customer-specific policy details and generate tailored messages across text, voice, and video.  
- **Smart Outreach Agent**: AI agent analyzes customer profile & past behavior to suggest the best time, channel, and frequency for reminders.  
- **Generative Visuals**: Create infographics and explainer videos projecting future value of policy benefits or risks of lapse.  
- **A/B Testing & Optimization**: Continuously test different nudge strategies to maximize renewal conversions.  
- **Feedback Integration**: Capture customer responses (e.g., clicked link, voice confirmation) to refine future outreach campaigns.
